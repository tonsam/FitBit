Heart Rate Monitoring during exercise

## Background

The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals are recorded from the wearer’s wrist. The PPG signal is recorded using embedded pulse oximeters which records a signal by illuminating the skin with an LED and measuring the intensity changes as the light reflects off the exercises during the wearer’s skin, forming a PPG signal. Each cycle of the PPG signal corresponds to a cardiac cycle,
thus the heart rate can be estimated from the periodicity of the PPG signal.
